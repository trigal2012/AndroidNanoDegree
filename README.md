## Project 2: Score Keeper App
1. key learnings:
    * create more sophisticated xmls to include buttons and other items users can interact with
    * start learning java and writing backend logic to generate the desired results based on user actions
2. Requirements: https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/157/view
3. Your Design must include:
    * The chosen game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored, as in american football, or multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs, and innings in baseball.
    * App is divided into two columns, one for each team.
    * Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team.
      ** Optionally, a second TextView to track another important metric such as fouls can be added.
    * Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either:
    * Each track a different kind of scoring, Or
    * Each score button updates the score TextView in its column by adding the correct number of points.
    * The reset button resets the scores on both of the score TextViews.
